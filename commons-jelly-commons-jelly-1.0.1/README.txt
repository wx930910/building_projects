Jelly
=====

The primary build tool for this project is Ant due to the need for
flexibility in building elderly projects. More specifically, we have
focused on building with Ant 1.6, and Java 1.5. For help with building
the project see the BUILDING.md, as we have supplied the mechanics for
using docker to build the project due to its antiquity.


Jelly contains a number of individual tag libraries which can be built 
by themselves by changing to the directory jelly-tags/foo and performing the
above commands to build the library you're interested in.
