 * where:
 * 
 * ADDRESS         An 32 bit Internet address
 * 
 * PROTOCOL        An 8 bit IP protocol number
 * 
 * &lt;BIT MAP&gt;       A variable length bit map.  The bit map must be a
 *                 multiple of 8 bits long.
 * 
 * The WKS record is used to describe the well known services supported by
 * a particular protocol on a particular internet address.  The PROTOCOL
 * field specifies an IP protocol number, and the bit map has one bit per
 * port of the specified protocol.  The first bit corresponds to port 0,
 * the second to port 1, etc.  If the bit map does not include a bit for a
 * protocol of interest, that bit is assumed zero.  The appropriate values
 * and mnemonics for ports and protocols are specified in [RFC-1010].
 * 
 * For example, if PROTOCOL=TCP (6), the 26th bit corresponds to TCP port
 * 25 (SMTP).  If this bit is set, a SMTP server should be listening on TCP
 * port 25; if zero, SMTP service is not supported on the specified
 * address.
 * 
 * The purpose of WKS RRs is to provide availability information for
 * servers for TCP and UDP.  If a server supports both TCP and UDP, or has
 * multiple Internet addresses, then multiple WKS RRs are used.
 * 
 * WKS RRs cause no additional section processing.
 * 
 * In master files, both ports and protocols are expressed using mnemonics
 * or decimal numbers.
