 * 
 * RNAME           A &lt;domain-name&gt; which specifies the mailbox of the
 *                 person responsible for this zone.
 * 
 * SERIAL          The unsigned 32 bit version number of the original copy
 *                 of the zone.  Zone transfers preserve this value.  This
 *                 value wraps and should be compared using sequence space
 *                 arithmetic.
 * 
 * REFRESH         A 32 bit time interval before the zone should be
 *                 refreshed.

 *                 failed refresh should be retried.
 * 
 * EXPIRE          A 32 bit time value that specifies the upper limit on
 *                 the time interval that can elapse before the zone is no
 *                 longer authoritative.
 * 
 * MINIMUM         The unsigned 32 bit minimum TTL field that should be
 *                 exported with any RR from this zone.
 * 
 * SOA records cause no additional section processing.
 * 
 * All times are in units of seconds.
 * 
 * Most of these fields are pertinent only for name server maintenance
 * operations.  However, MINIMUM is used in all query operations that
 * retrieve RRs from a zone.  Whenever a RR is sent in a response to a
 * query, the TTL field is set to the maximum of the TTL field from the RR
 * and the MINIMUM field in the appropriate SOA.  Thus MINIMUM is a lower
 * bound on the TTL field for all RRs in a zone.  Note that this use of
 * MINIMUM should occur when the RRs are copied into the response and not
 * when the zone is loaded from a master file or via a zone transfer.  The
 * reason for this provison is to allow future dynamic update facilities to
 * change the SOA RR with known semantics.
