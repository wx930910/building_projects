BSF 3.1
-------

The BSF 3.1 binary release contains several jars:

bsf-api-3.1.jar
- this contains all the javax.script classes as defined in the
  JSR-223 specification. This jar may be used as an application 
  dependency when the application is using javax.script classes
  in a version of Java prior to 1.6 (which includes the classes)

bsf-engines-3.1.jar
- this contains several JSR-223 script engine factories 
  which enable a script language to be used via the javax.script
  APIs. This jar does not include the actual script language 
  implementations, these need to be obtained separately.

bsf-utils-3.1.jar
- this contains various BSF specific utilities which aid using
  script languages from Java applications. 

bsf-all-3.1.jar
- this contains all the other BSF jars merged into a single jar for 
  ease of use. If you're not sure which jar to use then use this one.

BSF 3.1 is compatible with Java 1.4.2 and above. Specific script 
languages may have further requirements on the Java version.
