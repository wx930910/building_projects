Apache Jackrabbit JCR-RMI
===================================================

JCR-RMI is a transparent Remote Method Invocation (RMI) layer for JCR.
The layer makes it possible to remotely access JCR content repositories.

Note that due to changes in the way the RMI client is built, versions since
2.16 will not be able to connect to older versions of the server. If 
compatibility with older servers is needed, just use the client from a
recent 2.14 release.
