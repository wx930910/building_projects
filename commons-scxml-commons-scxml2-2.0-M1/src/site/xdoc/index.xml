 <section name="Commons SCXML">

  <p>
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/" target="_blank">State Chart XML (SCXML)</a> is currently a
  Working Draft specification published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
  SCXML provides a generic state-machine based execution environment based on Harel
  State Tables. SCXML is a candidate for the control language within 
  multiple markup languages coming out of the W3C (see the latest Working Draft for details).
  <em>Commons SCXML</em> is an implementation aimed at creating
  and maintaining a Java SCXML engine capable of executing a state machine defined 
  using a SCXML document, while abstracting out the environment interfaces.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
  The use cases for an SCXML engine are multiple and varied. Anything that can be
  represented as a UML state chart -- business process flows, view navigation bits,
  interaction or dialog management, and many more -- can leverage an SCXML engine
  library.

 <section name="Commons SCXML 2.0 Roadmap">
   <p>
     The current development for Commons SCXML is targeted towards a 2.0 release which will be aligned and compliant
     with the SCXML specification.
   </p>
   <p>
     A high-level overview of the technical and functional changes needed towards this goal are available on the
     <a href="roadmap.html">Commons SCXML 2.0 Roadmap</a>.

 <section name="Releases">
  <p>
  The latest release is v0.9. Read
  <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/scxml/tags/SCXML_0_9/RELEASE-NOTES.txt?view=markup">v0.9
  release notes</a> before upgrading.
  <a href="http://commons.apache.org/scxml/download_scxml.cgi">Download v0.9!</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  The first release was v0.5. The initial release version number was chosen
  to be 0.5 (rather than a 1.0) to better convey the fact that the
  underlying W3C specification is still a Working Draft, and subsequent changes
  to the Draft may warrant changes to portions of the library API. The core
  Commons SCXML APIs (SCXMLParser, SCXMLExecutor etc.) are stable.
  Portions such as processing of &lt;datamodel&gt; and &lt;invoke&gt; SCXML
  elements, on the other hand, are subject to change as further changes are
  expected in these sections of the W3C Working Draft. See Working Draft for
  details.

 <section name="Support">
  <p>
   The <a href="mail-lists.html">commons mailing lists</a> act as the main support forum.
   The user list is suitable for most library usage queries.
   The dev list is intended for the development discussion.
   Please remember that the lists are shared between all commons components,
   so prefix your email by [SCXML].

   Issues may be reported via <a href="issue-tracking.html">ASF JIRA</a>.
