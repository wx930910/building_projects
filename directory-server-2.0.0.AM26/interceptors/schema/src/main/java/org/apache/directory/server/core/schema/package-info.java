/**
 * Contains interfaces for schema object registry services and simple POJO
 * implementations of these services.  Other helper interfaces and classes are
 * included for handling monitoring of these services.
 * <p>
 * These services and their POJO implementations are purposefully kept really
 * simple here for a reason.  When one looks at these interfaces they stop and
 * think why even bother having them when you can just use a map of objects
 * somewhere.  These simple services can and will get more complex as other
 * facilities come into play namely the object builders that populate these
 * registries.  There might also be caching going on as well as disk based
 * store access.  Finally dependencies become an issue and sometime bootstrap
 * instances of these components are required by the system.  So these simple
 * watered down interfaces and their POJO's have been pruned from previously
 * complex environment specific versions of them.
 * <p>
 * Some key points to apply to services and their POJO impls in this package:
 * <ul>
 * <li>registries only register and allow for lookups: its that simple!</li>
 * <li>don't worry if they change over time</li>
 * <li>don't worry about how they get populated</li>
 * <li>don't worry who or what does the populating</li>
 * <li>don't worry about where the information comes from</li>
 * </ul>
